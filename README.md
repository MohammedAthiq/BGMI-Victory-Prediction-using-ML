# BGMI-Victory-Prediction-using-ML

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a player will win or lose a BGMI match based on gameplay stats like kills, damage, distance walked, and more.

## 📁 Files Included

- `BGMI_VICTORY_FINAL.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with model training and predictions
- `BGMI_NEW_DATA.csv` — Dataset used for training and testing

## 🤖 Model

- Random Forest Classifier
- Features used: Kills, Damage, Assists, Heals, WalkDistance, etc.

## ✅ Prediction

The model outputs:
- **1 = Win**
- **0 = Loss**

## 🧪 Example

If a player has 6 kills, 850 damage, and walks 1200m → the model may predict: **Win**
