# BGMI-Victory-Prediction-using-ML
This project uses machine learning to predict whether a player will win or lose a BGMI match based on their in-game stats like kills, damage, and distance walked. It includes a quick look at the dataset, selects key features, trains a Random Forest model, and even lets you test predictions for new player stats.
